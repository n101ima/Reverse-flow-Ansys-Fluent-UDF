# Reverse-flow-Ansys-Fluent-UDF
This UDF defines a profile for the temperature boundary condition on a face zone. The profile is based on the reverse flow condition, which means that the temperature of the face is equal to the temperature of the adjacent cell if the flow is entering the domain through the face. Otherwise, the temperature of the face is specified by the user.

The UDF uses the following parameters and variables:

•  reverse_profile: the name of the profile function.

•  f_thread: a pointer to the thread structure of the face zone.

•  i: an index that indicates which scalar variable is being set by the profile. In this case, it is the temperature.

•  A[ND_ND]: an array that stores the area vector of the face.

•  u[ND_ND]: an array that stores the velocity vector of the face.

•  ds: a scalar that stores the area magnitude of the face.

•  es[ND_ND]: an array that stores the unit normal vector of the face.

•  A_by_es: a scalar that stores the dot product of A and es.

•  dr0[ND_ND]: an array that stores the vector from the face centroid to the cell centroid.

•  face_t face: a variable that represents a single face in the face loop.

•  ID: an integer that specifies the ID of the face zone. In this case, it is 7.

•  Thread *t: a pointer to the thread structure of the cell zone adjacent to the face zone.

•  cell_t c: a variable that represents a single cell in the cell loop.

The UDF uses macros from
the Fluent UDF library, such as:

•  DEFINE_PROFILE, which defines a profile function for a boundary condition.

•  BOUNDARY_FACE_GEOMETRY, which calculates various geometric quantities for a boundary face.

•  ND_SET, which sets an ND_ND dimensional vector with three scalar values.

•  NV_DOT, which calculates

the dot product of two ND_ND dimensional vectors.
•  F_U, F_V, and

F_W, which return
the x, y, and z components
of
the velocity at
the face, respectively.
•  begin_f_loop and

end_f_loop, which mark
the beginning and end
of
a loop over all faces in a thread.
•  F_C0, which returns

the cell adjacent to
the face on side 0.
•  THREAD_T0, which returns

the thread adjacent to
the face on side 0.
•  F_PROFILE, which sets or accesses

the value
of
a scalar variable at
the face.
•  C_T, which returns

the temperature
of
the cell.

The UDF can be used to model heat transfer problems with reverse flow, such as natural convection and heat exchangers.
